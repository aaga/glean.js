Before you dive into technical details, take a moment to read our 
[code of conduct](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Any form of communication from chat rooms and mailing lists to code comments
is expected to follow this code of conduct, so that all can enjoy working on Glean.js.

Glean.js' developer document lives in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/tree/main/docs/index.md)
folder in this repository and Glean.js' user documentation lives in [The Glean Book](https://mozilla.github.io/glean/book/index.html).

Here's the [guide](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/blob/main/docs/guides/getting_started.md) to get you started!

## Bug reports / Feature Requests

If you are using Glean.js and found a bug or a missing feature, please file a bug.

Glean.js bugs are filed in Bugzilla. Use [this link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Data+Platform+and+Tools&component=Glean.js&priority=P4&status_whiteboard=%5Btelemetry%3Aglean-js%3Am%3F%5D)
to file a bug in the Glean.js Bugzilla component.

## Finding a bug to work on

As mentioned, Glean.js bugs are filed in Bugzilla. Anything on the Glean.js component
with the tag [`[good first bug]`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?f1=status_whiteboard&v1=%5Bgood%20first%20bug%5D&o1=substring&resolution=---&query_format=advanced&f2=component&v2=Glean.js&list_id=15653400&o2=equals&classification=Client%20Software&classification=Developer%20Infrastructure&classification=Components&classification=Server%20Software&classification=Other)
is a good place to start.

These bugs will usually have a comment explaining the steps to get started working on them.
(If you find a `[good first bug]` that doesn't have an explanation comment, please ask for one).

If you are picking a good first bug or not, make sure you are assigned to the bug before sending a Pull Request for it.

> **Note** When you do send a Pull Request, make sure its title starts `Bug <number of the bug> - `, 
> this triggers an action to attach your Pull Request to the Bugzilla bug you are working on.
