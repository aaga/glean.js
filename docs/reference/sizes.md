# Estimated bundle sizes

The size of the Glean.js bundle varies depending on the metric types and plugins being used.

## Minimum bundle

The minimum bundle imports only the metric types used by Glean itself, e.g.
error metrics, internal metrics, `client_info` metrics and `ping_info` metrics.

To check out a comprehensive list of which metrics are collected by Glean and their types check out
["Metrics collected by Glean.js"](https://github.com/mozilla/glean.js/blob/main/docs/reference/metrics.md).

|| Size |
|--|--|
|web|**53 KB**|
|webext|**52 KB**|
|node|**52 KB**|
|QML|**68 KB**|
<!-- ! -->

> **Note**: The QML bundle contains all the metric types and is not distributed through the
> `@mozilla/glean` package, but instead through the releases page on this repository.

## Additional metric types

These metric types are not used by Glean itself,
thus using each of them will result in a larger bundle.

## Plugins

Plugins add extra functionality to Glean.
Using a plugin also means a size impact on the final bundle.
